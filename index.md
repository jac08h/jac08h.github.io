# Welcome!

Hi! 

My name is Jakub and I am currently studying Artificial intelligence and data processing at Masaryk University in Brno.

This website serves as a crossroad between my various endeavors: You can look at some of my [programming projects](/programming). There's also my [collection of quotes](/books/quotes) from books I've read, as well as [my favourite books](/books/picks) read in a given year. I sometimes publish at my [blog](https://jakubhalmes.substack.com/). I hope you enjoy your stay!
