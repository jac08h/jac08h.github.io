# Welcome!

Hi! 

I'm Jakub, currently studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing at Masaryk University in Brno.

This website serves as a crossroad between various endeavors: Browse through [programming projects](/programming) or visit the [blog](https://jakubhalmes.substack.com/). 
There is also a [collection of book quotes](/books/quotes) and a list of [my favorite reads](/books/picks). I hope you enjoy your stay!
