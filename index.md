# Welcome!

Hi! 

I'm Jakub, currently studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing at Masaryk University in Brno.

This website serves as a crossroad between various endeavors: Check out some [programming projects](/programming), browse through a [collection of quotes](/books/quotes) from fascinating reads, or explore [recommended books](/books/picks) from each year. Occasional thoughts appear at this [blog](https://jakubhalmes.substack.com/). Enjoy your stay!
