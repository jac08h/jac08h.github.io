# Welcome

Hi! 

I'm Jakub, currently working as an AI Engineer at [Chyron](https://chyron.com/).

This website serves as a crossroad between various endeavors: Browse through [programming projects](/programming) or visit the [blog](https://unpredictabletokens.substack.com/). 
There is also a [collection of book quotes](/books/quotes) and a list of [my favorite reads](/books/picks). I hope you enjoy your stay!
