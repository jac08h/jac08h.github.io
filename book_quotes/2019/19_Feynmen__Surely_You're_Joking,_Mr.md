## Feynmen - Surely You're Joking, Mr

There was always some kind of difficulty with the letters going back and forth.
For example, my wife kept mentioning the fact that she felt uncomfortable writing with the feeling that the censor is looking over her shoulder.
Now, as a rule, we aren't supposed to mention censorship.
We aren't, but how can they tellher? So they keep sending me a note: "Your wife mentioned censorship."
Certainly,my wife mentioned censorship.
So finally they sent me a note that said, "Please inform your wife not to mention censorship in her letters.
So I start my letter: "I have been instructed to inform you not to mention censorship in your letters."
