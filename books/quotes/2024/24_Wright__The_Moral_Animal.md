## Wright - The Moral Animal

t is remarkable that a creative process devoted to selfishness could produce organisms which, having finally discerned this creator, reflect on this central value and reject it.
More remarkable still, this happened in record time; the very first organism ever to see its creator did precisely that.
Darwin's moral sentiments, designed ultimately to serve selfishness, renounced this criterion of design as soon as it became explicit.
