## Towles - The Lincoln Highway

This time, when the glass made it to his lips he took a healthy swallow, like he was making up for the drink he hadn’t taken before.
Then, setting the glass down, he looked at me and waited.
Because that’s what has-beens do: They wait.

When it comes to waiting, has-beens have had plenty of practice.
Like when they were waiting for their big break, or for their number to come in.
Once it became clear that those things weren’t going to happen, they started waiting for other things.
Like for the bars to open, or the welfare check to arrive.
Before too long, they were waiting to see what it would be like to sleep in a park, or to take the last two puffs from a discarded cigarette.
They were waiting to see what new indignity they could become accustomed to while they were waiting to be forgotten by those they once held dear.
But most of all, they waited for the end.
