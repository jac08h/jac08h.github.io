## Towles - Rules of Civility

In that sense, life is less like a journey than it is a game of honeymoon bridge.
In our twenties, when there is still so much time ahead of us, time that seems ample for a hundred indecisions, for a hundred visions and revisions—we draw a card, and we must decide right then and there whether to keep that card and discard the next, or discard the first card and keep the second.
And before we know it, the deck has been played out and the decisions we have just made will shape our lives for decades to come.
 
Maybe that sounds bleaker than I intended.

Life doesn’t have to provide you any options at all.
It can easily define your course from the outset and keep you in check through all manner of rough and subtle mechanics.
To have even one year when you’re presented with choices that can alter your circumstances, your character, your course—that’s by the grace of God alone.
And it shouldn’t come without a price.
