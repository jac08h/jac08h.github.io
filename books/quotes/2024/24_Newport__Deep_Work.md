## Newport - Deep Work

Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had been developing over the preceding decade: “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”
Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title).
At the time, this finding pushed back against conventional wisdom.
Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy.
We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock.
But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most people have this wrong: 

"Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.
Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed."
