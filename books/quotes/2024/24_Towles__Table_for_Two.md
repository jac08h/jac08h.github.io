## Towles - Table for Two

The road along which a young man discovers what he is capable of is no midwestern interstate.
It has no uninterrupted views to the horizon, no painted white lines, no brightly lit signs indicating the distance to one’s destination.
Rather, it is a narrow and winding byway crowded with undergrowth and overhung with branches.
Along his journey, the young man is presented with sudden intersections, divergent footpaths, and fateful detours, each of which, if taken, will lead him to other byways with their own intersections, footpaths, and detours.
So intricate are the paths and so wooded the way, at any given point it is almost impossible for a young man to see from whence he’s come, never mind to where he’s headed.
