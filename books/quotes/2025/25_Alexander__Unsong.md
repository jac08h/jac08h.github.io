## Alexander - Unsong

Atheistic science should be thought of not as a literal attempt to say things like "space is infinite and full of stars" or "humankind evolved from apes" that were now known to be untrue, but as an attempt to record, in the form of stories, our ancestors' answers to those great questions.
When a scientist says "space is infinite and full of stars", she does not literally mean that the crystal sphere surrounding the Earth doesn't exist.
She is metaphorically referring to the infinitude of the human spirit, the limitless possibilities it offers, and the brightness and enlightenment waiting to be discovered.
Or when a scientist says "humankind evolved from apes", she is not literally doubting the word of the archangel Uriel that humankind was created ex nihilo on October 13, 3761 BC and evolution added only as part of a later retconning – she is saying that humankind has an animal nature that it has barely transcended and to which it is always at risk of returning.
When religious people mocked atheists for supposedly getting their cosmology wrong, they were missing the true grandeur and beauty of atheism, a grandeur which had been passed on undiminished from Democritus to the present day and connected us to the great thinkers of times past.
