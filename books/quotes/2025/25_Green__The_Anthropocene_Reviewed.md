## Green - The Anthropocene Reviewed

They knew me far better than anyone in my real life. I remember one evening in an instant message conversation, I told my CompuServe friend Marie about the night feeling. The night feeling was my private name for the wave that crashed over me most school nights when I got into bed. My stomach would tighten and I'd feel the worry radiating out from my belly button. I'd never told anyone about the night feeling, and my heart was racing as I typed. Marie responded that she also knew the night feeling, and that she sometimes found comfort in listening quietly to her clock radio. I tried that, and it helped.
