## Plokhy - The Russo-Ukrainian War

For many of Ukraine's friends, this war became not only the largest and deadliest military conflict in Europe since the end of World War II, but also the first major war since the victory over Nazism in which there were few shades of gray when it came to its moral dimensions. It was the first "good war" since the global conflict of 1939–45, in which it was very clear from the start who was the aggressor and who the victim, who was the villain and who the hero, and whose side one wanted to be on.
