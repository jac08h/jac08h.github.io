## Camus - Stranger

They always came for one at dawn; that much I knew.
So, really, all my nights were spent in waiting for that dawn.
I have never liked being taken by surprise.
When something happens to me I want to be ready for it.
That’s why I got into the habit of sleeping off and on in the daytime and watching through the night for the first hint of daybreak in the dark dome above.
The worst period of the night was that vague hour when, I knew, they usually come; once it was after midnight I waited, listening intently.
Never before had my ears perceived so many noises, such tiny sounds.
Still, I must say I was lucky in one respect; never during any of those periods did I hear footsteps.
Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there’s always something to be thankful for.
And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her.
Because I might just as well have heard footsteps, and felt my heart shattered into bits.
Even though the faintest rustle sent me hurrying to the door and, pressing an ear to the rough, cold wood, I listened so intently that I could hear my breathing, quick and hoarse like a dog’s panting—even so there was an end; my heart hadn’t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four hours’ respite.
