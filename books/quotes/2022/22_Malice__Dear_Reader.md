## Malice - Dear Reader

Dear reader, while students in your schools wring their hands, wondering how the Nazi camps could have been allowed to happen, children in our enlightenment centers are being clubbed to death in front of their peers for stealing grains of corn.
While ladies in your stores complain about the fit of their clothes, women in our enlightenment centers are having their legs amputated for submitting to rape—and then using tires to push themselves to report to work.
While men in your offices stress over their workload, men in our enlightenment centers are sent to mines that they will knowingly die in, literally never seeing sunlight again.
There’s nothing you can do about it, and there’s nothing that your leaders—or any world leaders—will do about it.
