## Eagleman - Sum

You are immediately dropped into a work life of simultaneous contradictions.
You are concurrently practicing several careers at once, all the carers you had considered when you were younger.
You simultaneously count down your rocket ship launch and defend a criminal client in front of a jury.
In the same moments, you scrub your hands for a gallbladder surgery and navigate an eighteen-wheeler down a New Mexico interstate.
Gone are the constraints of location and time.
  "This," you tell the angel, "is too much work."
"Perhaps we could warm you up with a simpler situation," he considers.
"How would you like to be in a closed room, one-on-one with your lover?"
  And then you are here.
You are simultaneously engaged in her conversation and thinking about something else; she both gives herself to you and does not gibe herself to you; you find her objectionable and you deeply love her; she worships you and wonders what she might have missed with someone else.
 "Thank you," you tell the angel.
"This I'm used to."
