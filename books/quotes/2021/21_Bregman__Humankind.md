## Bregman - Humankind

Considering the most recent evidence of psychology and biology, of archaeology and anthropology, of sociology and history, we can only conclude that humans have for millennia navigated by a faulty self-image.
For ages, we’ve assumed that people are selfish, that we’re beasts, or worse.
For ages, we’ve believed civilisation is a flimsy veneer that will crack at the merest provocation.
Now we know this view of humankind, and this perspective on our history, is utterly unrealistic.
