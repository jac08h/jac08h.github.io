## Peterson - Beyond Order

That is Mephistopheles, whose essential viewpoint might be paraphrased as follows: “Life is so terrible, because of its limitations and malevolence, that it would be better if it did not exist at all.”
That is the central doctrine of the spirit that works at counterpurposes to you.
It is an arguable case and not surprising that it should emerge, and it seems terribly credible at moments of crisis, even though I believe it is deeply wrong.
I think the reason that it is wrong, in part, is because, when it is realized, all it does is exacerbate an already admittedly bad situation.
