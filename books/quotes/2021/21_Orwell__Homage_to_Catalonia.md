## Orwell - Homage to Catalonia

I went back to my post on the roof with a feeling of concentrated disgust and fury,
When you are taking part in events like these you are, I suppose, in a small way, making history, and you ought by rights to feel like an historical character.
But you never do, because at such times the physical details always outweigh everything else.
Throughout the fighting I never made the correct 'analysis' of the situation that was so glibly made by journalists hundreds of miles away.
What I was chiefly thinking about was not the rights and wrongs of this miserable interneine scrap, but simply the discomfort and boredom of sitting day and night on that intolerable roof, and the hunger which was growing worse and worse - for none of us had had a proper meal since Monday.
It was in my mind all the while that I should have to go back to the front as soon as this business was over.
It was infuriating.
I had been a hundred and fifteen days in the line and had come back to Barcelona ravenous for a bit of rest and comfort; and instead I had to spend my time sitting on a roof opposite Assault Guards as bored as myself, who periodically waved to me and assured me that they were 'workers' (meaning that they hoped I would not shoot them), but who would certainly open fire if they got the order to do so.
If this was history it did not feel like it.
It was more like a bad period at the frond, when men were short and we had to do abnormal hours of guard-duty; instead of being heroic one just had to stay at one's post, bored, dropping with sleep and completely uninterested as to what it was all about.
