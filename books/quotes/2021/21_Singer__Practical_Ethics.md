## Singer - Practical Ethics

When he had cancer and knew that the end was not far away, I asked him what had driven him to spend his life working for others.
He replied:
	"I guess basically one wants to feel that one's life has amounted to more than just consuming products and generating garbage.
	I think that one likes to look back and say that one's done the best one can to make this a better place for others.
	You can look at it from this point of view: what greater motivation can there be than doing whatever one possibly can to reduce pain and suffering?"
That answer will not provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally.
It cannot be proven that we are all rationally required to reduce pain and suffering and make the world a better place for others.
Ethically indefensible behaviour is not always irrational.
We will probably always need the sanctions of the law and social pressure to provide additional reasons against serious violations of ethical standards.
On the other hand, those reflective enough to ask why they should act ethically are also those most likely to appreciate the reasons Spira offered for taking the ethical point of view.
