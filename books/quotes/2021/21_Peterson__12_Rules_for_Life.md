## Peterson - 12 Rules for Life

Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean.
Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens.
Then pay attention.
Note your errors.
Articulate them.
Strive to correct them.
That is how you discover the meaning of your life.
That will protect you from the tragedy of your life.
How could it be otherwise?
