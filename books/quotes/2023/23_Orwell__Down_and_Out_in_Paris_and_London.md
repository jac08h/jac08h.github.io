## Orwell - Down and Out in Paris and London

It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty.
You have thought so much about povertyâ€“it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen to you sooner or later; and it is all so utterly and prosaically different.
You thought it would be quite simple; it is extraordinarily complicated.
You thought it would be terrible; it is merely squalid and boring.
It is the peculiar lowness of poverty that you discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.
