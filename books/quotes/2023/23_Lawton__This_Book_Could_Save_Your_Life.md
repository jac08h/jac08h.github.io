## Lawton - This Book Could Save Your Life

To be clear, I’m not entirely dismissing ‘it worked for me’.
Human bodies are complex and varied – but averaging out across large groups of people is the method of health science.
So it is possible that something that doesn’t work for the average human does work for you.
It’s possible, but unlikely.
There’s also the placebo effect, whereby merely believing that something will work can lead it actually to work.
But, again, I’d always advocate following where the evidence leads.
