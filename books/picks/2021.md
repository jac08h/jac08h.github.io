## The Joke
### by Milan Kundera
Very captivating, depressing but lively book. I enjoyed very accurately painted grey, depressing image of communist regime, capturing slow, sad tragedy of handful of individuals. Switching of the styles of the writing between protagonists made the book even more interesting.
I think this is what great novel looks like: immersive story with tinges of philosophy or things to think about that stay with the reader for a long time.

## The Brothers Karamazov
### by Fyodor Dostoevsky
I enjoyed the themes explored, like religion or free will, and the plot was engaging throughout the whole book, despite it's length.

## Beyond Order
### by Jordan Peterson
I find the Jordan's writing very compelling.
Though most of the rules appear self-evident, I find it useful to spend time thinking about them. And I believe it is a great skill to pinpoint and name even the self-evident or implicit truths.

## To Kill a Mockingbird
### by Harper Lee
Beautiful and authentic little book.

## The Fountainhead
### by Ayn Rand
What I enjoyed was that the themes and motives weren't straight-forward and I think there is a lot there to find even with a re-read. That may be part of what made it special to me - I feel like there is still a lot in the book to discover.
