## The Selfish Gene
### by Richard Dawkins
One of the best popular book I have read. Each chapter unveiled something new and exciting about the biology. It made me think for a long time after finishing the book, which is always a sign of great literature.

## The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich
### by William L. Shirer
Who would have thought that the WWII history would be so gripping! I was thrilled during the whole duration of the audiobook. A unique experience.

## Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
### by Eliezer Yudkowsky
Another not-so-short book which I could not put off. Captivating and a fun reading.

## Elon Musk
### by Walter Isaacson
I love biographies, and I enjoyed this one as well. They make me appreciate the complexities and depth of the people, often reduced to flat and simple personalities in the headlines or short articles.

## The Pillars of the Earth
### by Ken Folett
This book transported me to the times long gone. It was an immersive experience which filled a hole in my historical awareness of 12th century with vivid scenes from lives of the characters.
