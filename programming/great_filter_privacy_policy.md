# Privacy Policy for Great Filter Extension

Great Filter stores your filtering preferences (topics and API settings) locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage system. This data never leaves your browser and is only used to maintain your personalized filtering configuration across sessions.

When filtering content, the extension sends post titles and text from social media sites (YouTube, Reddit, X, Hacker News) along with your configured topics to AI services for analysis. This content is processed anonymously in real-time to determine filtering decisions. No personal information, browsing history, or identifying data is included in these requests.

The extension does not collect, store, or share any other data.
