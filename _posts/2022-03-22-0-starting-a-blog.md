Many people claim that writing down one's thoughts is the best way to clarify, organize and solidify knowledge. I find this pretty plausible, although I have never seriously tried it. I jot down some of my thoughts now and then, but only in the form of quick points for future reference, without giving it much thought. I want to try something different - putting together at least a couple of structured sentences, or perhaps even paragraphs. 


I decided to publish these writings online. The idea is that the prospect of actual people reading what I wrote will push me to keep trying my best.


A secondary reason is to improve my English, which, I am afraid, has plateaued. It appears that active usage of the language is needed to keep improving.


I can see many reasons for which I might stop posting. I may not have anything to write. Refining the text might be too time-consuming. Perhaps I will find it neither helpful nor enjoyable.


I think it is unlikely I will blog regularly and for a more extended period. But maybe I will keep at it. And perhaps someone will find something I wrote interesting or useful.


The only way to find out is to try.
